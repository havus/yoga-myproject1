        Ships are typically larger than boats, but there is 
        no universally accepted distinction between the two. 
        Ships generally can remain at sea for longer periods 
        of time than boats.[3] A legal definition of ship from 
        Indian case law is a vessel that carries goods by sea.
        [4] A common notion is that a ship can carry a boat, 
        but not vice versa.[5] A ship is likely to have a 
        full-time crew assigned.[6] A US Navy rule of thumb 
        is that ships heel towards the outside of a sharp turn,
        whereas boats heel towards the inside[7] because of the
        relative location of the center of mass versus the 
        center of buoyancy.[8][9] American and British 19th 
        century maritime law distinguished "vessels" from other
        watercraft; ships and boats fall in one legal category, 
        whereas open boats and rafts are not considered vessels.[10]
        Particularly in the Age of Sail, the word ship might apply
        generally to a seagoing vessel or particularly to a 
        full-rigged sailing ship with three or more masts, all 
        square-rigged. Other rigs on seagoing vessels included 
        brig, barque, and barquentine.
        Some large vessels are traditionally called boats, notably

        A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's 
        oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying 
        cargo or passengers, or in support of specialized 
        missions, such as defense, research, and fishing. Ships 
        are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, 
        shape, load capacity, and purpose.
        submarines.[14] Others include Great Lakes freighters, 
        riverboats, and ferryboats, which may be designed for 
        operation on inland or protected coastal waters.[10]
        In most maritime traditions ships have individual names, 
        and modern ships may belong to a ship class often named 
        after its first ship.
        In many documents the ship name is introduced with a ship 
        prefix being an abbreviation of the ship class, for 
        example "MS" (motor ship) or "SV" (sailing vessel), making 
        it easier to distinguish a ship name from other individual
        names in a text.
        "Ship" (along with "nation") is an English word that has 
        retained a female grammatical gender in some usages, which
        allows it sometimes to be referred to as a "she" without 
        being of female natural gender.[15]
